# predicting-bike-sharing-patterns
This is my first project in Deep Learning Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/deep-learning)

In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more...

# Setup
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Melmarn/predicting-bike-sharing-patterns.git

Install PyTorch, torchvision and a few required pip packages, see in notebook.
